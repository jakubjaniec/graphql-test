# Graphql Test

Generated by the [DOR‚ö°Ô∏è CLI][dor_cli_link] ü§ñ

DOR Project created by DOR CLI.

---

## Getting Started üöÄ


Before running DOR Project created by DOR CLI. you need to run those commands:

```sh
 flutter pub get

 flutter pub run build_runner build --delete-conflicting-outputs
```

If you would like to connect the project with Firebase please follow with documentation which you can find at
[firebase_documentation]
then uncomment lines 27 & 28 in main.dart.
Otherwise remove those lines and clear imports in this file at lines 4 & 5.


This project contains 3 flavors:

- Production
- Staging
- Dev

To run the desired flavor either use the launch configuration in VSCode/Android Studio or use the following commands:

```sh
# Production
$ flutter run --flavor production --dart-define=ENVIRONMENT=production --target lib/main.dart

# Staging
$ flutter run --flavor staging --dart-define=ENVIRONMENT=staging --target lib/main.dart

# Dev
$ flutter run --flavor dev --dart-define=ENVIRONMENT=dev --target lib/main.dart
```

---

## Generating files

Some packages used in the project require the developer to generate files. To do that, run this command in the project workspace:

```sh
flutter pub run build_runner build --delete-conflicting-outputs
```

To generate l10n files, run:

```sh
flutter pub global run intl_utils:generate
```

## Working with Translations üåê

This project relies on [flutter_localizations][flutter_localizations_link] and follows the [official internationalization guide for Flutter][internationalization_link].

### Adding Strings

1. To add a new localizable string, open the `app_en.arb` file at `lib/l10n/arb/app_en.arb`.

```arb
{
    "@@locale": "en",
    "counterAppBarTitle": "Counter",
    "@counterAppBarTitle": {
        "description": "Text shown in the AppBar of the Counter Page"
    }
}
```

2. Then add a new key/value and description

```arb
{
    "@@locale": "en",
    "counterAppBarTitle": "Counter",
    "@counterAppBarTitle": {
        "description": "Text shown in the AppBar of the Counter Page"
    },
    "helloWorld": "Hello World",
    "@helloWorld": {
        "description": "Hello World Text"
    }
}
```

3. Use the new string

```dart
import 'package:graphql_test/generated/l10n.dart';

@override
Widget build(BuildContext context) {
  return Text(Strings.of(context).helloWorld);
}
```

### Adding Supported Locales

Update the `CFBundleLocalizations` array in the `Info.plist` at `ios/Runner/Info.plist` to include the new locale.

```xml
    ...

    <key>CFBundleLocalizations</key>
	<array>
		<string>en</string>
		<string>es</string>
	</array>

    ...
```

### Adding Translations

1. For each supported locale, add a new ARB file in `lib/l10n/arb`.

```
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ l10n
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ arb
‚îÇ   ‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ app_en.arb
‚îÇ   ‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ app_es.arb
```

2. Add the translated strings to each `.arb` file:

`app_en.arb`

```arb
{
    "@@locale": "en",
    "counterAppBarTitle": "Counter",
    "@counterAppBarTitle": {
        "description": "Text shown in the AppBar of the Counter Page"
    }
}
```

`app_es.arb`

```arb
{
    "@@locale": "es",
    "counterAppBarTitle": "Contador",
    "@counterAppBarTitle": {
        "description": "Texto mostrado en la AppBar de la p√°gina del contador"
    }
}
```

### iOS Push Notification Entitlement

The Push Notification Entitlements are automatically added by [dor_cli][dor_cli_link]. The main reason why entitlements are added is to get around this [issue][push_notification_entitlement_gh_issue].  

**Remove entitlements before releasing the app if it doesn't use push notifications.**

## iOS app versioning
Xcode should automatically get the app version from `pubspec.yaml` file, as `MARKETING_VERSION` is set to `"$(FLUTTER_BUILD_NAME)"`. 

Be cautious to not change the `Version` field in the Xcode (Targer/Runner/General tab) to not loose this synchronisation between Xcode and `pubspec.yaml` as it will override the `MARKETING_VERSION` value.

After changing the app version in `pubspec.yaml`, to see this changes in Xcode you need to run these commands in terminal:
- `flutter clean`
- `flutter pub get` - after this command the Version field in Xcode will be updates
- `cd ios`
- `pod install` - after this command pods are in sync with the project and Xcode can execute actions like `Product -> Archive`.

This is just in case you need to test something locally in Xcode.
